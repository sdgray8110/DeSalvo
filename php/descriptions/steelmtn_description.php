    Mountain bikes are very utilitarian; they can be used for touring, trips to the supermarket, commuting, or - best of all - sailing through some pristine singletrack. These are the bikes you ride all day, everyday. Just as with all of the bikes from DeSalvo cycles, our mountain frames are hand built one at a time to ensure a great ride and years of enjoyment. We offer these bikes in your choice of semi-c?ustom or full custom geometry and in two different Columbus tube sets to fit any application or budget.
