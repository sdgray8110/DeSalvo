    Whether you're mixing it up at the track, zipping in and out of traffic to get that package delivered on time, or perfecting your pedal stroke, it is hard to improve on the simple beauty of track bikes. Here at DeSalvo we love them and build lots of them for different purposes. Give us a call when you are ready for the ultimate fixie.

    As with our road bikes you have the option of lugged or TIG welded construction on our track frames. Standard on all of our track frames are the Paragon Machine horizontal dropouts that give you the option of a bottle opener on the non-drive side for those beverages to be enjoyed after a hard ride.
