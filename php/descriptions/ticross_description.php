    Hang on to your hats, cowboys and girls: when you straddle a DeSalvo Cycles titanium 'cross bike, you best be ready for a lively mount and mud between the teeth. Yeehaw! Nothing but the best of pedigree in this fine steed, something you'll be sure to appreciate whether secure in the saddle or chasing it down on foot. Perched lightly on the shoulder, surging forward with each pedal stroke, or - heck - just moseying to the general store, this machine could well become your best friend. Pavement, dirt, or trail, the Ti 'cross just begs to get out of the stable. You'll be riding 'til the cows come home.
