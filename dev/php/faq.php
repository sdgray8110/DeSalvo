            <div class="slider">
                <p>'Semi-custom' is what we call our steel production bikes. We prefer to use the term semi-custom because although we have made the geometry and sizing decisions for you, there are some final choices you will make to give your bike a personal touch. Included in the price of each frame is a single color powder coat with painted logos. You will get to decide on the colors. If you would like to be more creative you can come up with a design of your choice, anything from panels to fades to flames to whatever you can imagine.</p>
                <p>Let us know what you would like and we will give you a quote. In addition to the finish you will also decide on the size and shape of the tubes to create a frame that fits your riding style. Cable routing, any additional braze-ons, extra water bottles, racks, or a disc brake mount are other choices you can make.</p>
