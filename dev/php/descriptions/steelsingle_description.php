    My first mountain bike race as a teen was on a single speed. The bike was a 24-inch cruiser, complete with platform pedals and BMX handlebars, which tipped the scales at over 30 pounds. Thankfully, single speeds have come a long way since then. DeSalvo single speeds are light, efficient, and a blast to ride. If you've been on a single speed before, you know what it's all about.

    If you're among the uninitiated but looking for a new challenge, give a single speed a try. The only thing you'll regret is having to decide which frame to get. We offer two models of steel single speeds, and the choice is yours. Both single speed models are built to accept 100mm travel suspension forks and now come standard for disc brakes using either an EBB or slider dropouts.
