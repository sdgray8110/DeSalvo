    For those of you who are looking for the ultimate hardtail - whether for competition, adventure, or just plain fun - we offer frames crafted from titanium. These bikes will give you the resilient ride that titanium is known for as well as the corrosion resistance that will make your ti bike a lifetime investment. Build to take all the abuse you can dish out, in a loving-yet-codependent sort of way.

    These frames bring you the best of all worlds: you'd never think a workhorse could be so dang pretty, light, and responsive. Our ti bikes come with s-bend chain stays and seat stays for added tire clearance and come stock with a hand-brushed finish and a decal in your choice of color. This baby will be your baby.
