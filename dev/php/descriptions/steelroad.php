    When you are looking for a smooth ride to propel you to the top of a mountain pass and escort you to the bottom of the winding descent with a grin on your face, we have the perfect bike for you: a DeSalvo Cycles steel road bike. Our steel road frames are available in different styles to meet your needs and desires.

    First off: we like lugs, so if you are a fan of this classic style of construction we can build you your dream machine using only the finest investment cast lugs. For our exquisitely clean TIG welded road bikes we offer the option of a compact frame style to give you a slightly stiffer ride and increased stand-over clearance or a level top tube for a classic look. We use size-specific tubing to achieve the perfect blend of compliance and rigidity, regardless of your size. Whichever you choose will give you a superb ride just rearing to get out and log the miles.
