    Here it is: the answer to your prayers. When your quest takes you searching for the finest ride beneath the heavens, you're ready for the DeSalvo Cycles titanium road frame. To behold one of these beauties is to witness all that is magnificent in a bicycle. To ride one is to encounter nirvana. So smooth you'll swear the road was just paved. So light you'll testify to a reduction in gravity. So fast you'll praise the everlasting tail winds. No question of faith on this one: it's pure rapture. Only problem is: you can't take it with you when you're gone.

    We pair these wonderful frames with carbon forks to achieve a ride that is second to none. Just as with all of our frames from DeSalvo Cycles, we hand-build these one at a time to produce a frame that will last you a lifetime. Or more.
