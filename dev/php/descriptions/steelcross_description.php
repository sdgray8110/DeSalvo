    Cyclocross bikes are difficult to categorize, but they sure are a lot of fun to ride. They're great not only for 'cross racing, but also for that epic dirt road ride, a weekend tour, a change of pace on your local singletrack, or a speedy urban cruise. Still, to keep a Cyclocross bike out of the mud or off your shoulder would be a shame, akin to keeping a Ferrari in the garage. These things love to play. Our 'cross bikes feature slightly higher bottom brackets for increased pedal clearance and your option of a level or sloping top tube for more stand-over room. Like all of the steel bikes from DeSalvo Cycles, you have your choice different Columbus tube sets.
