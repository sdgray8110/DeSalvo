            <h5>BUILDERS SPECIAL! COMPLETE ROAD BIKE $3550</h5>
            <p>While doing a bit of house cleaning over the holidays I came across a hand full of Reynolds Ouzo Pro forks with carbon stays that need a good home. This being one of my all time favorite steel bike set ups I figured I would offer them as a sweet complete bike package. The deal is that I have six of these -- (3) for 54cm - 56cm bikes and (3) for 58cm - 60cm bikes. Included in this package is a Columbus Life steel frame with carbon seatstays and a Reynolds Ouzo pro fork. The build kit will be a complete SRAM force kit with a Chris King headset and Rol Race Sl wheels. The bar stem and post will be Ritchey WCS aluminium. Get them while they are hot -- when they are gone they're gone!</p>
